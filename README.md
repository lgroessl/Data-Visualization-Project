# Data-Visualization-Project
This project was assigned in Data Visualization (BAN 370). The goal of the project was to tell a story with a data visualization in Google Colab with a topic of the student's choice. 
I utilized Google Colab to do some data exploration before determining how I wanted to visualize the data. I decided to focus in on certain variables that had high correlation or ones that people would stereotypically think effect academic performance.
